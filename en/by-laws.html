Where acquired by holders of such Bonds, other than a Province or the National Government, class B shares of stock shall become Class D shares of stock;</p>
					<p>(iii) Class C shares of stock: originally designed by the National Government for the Corporation's employees under the Shared Ownership Program set forth in Law No. 23696. Class C shares of stock not purchased by the Corporation's employees under the Shared Ownership Program shall become class A shares of stock; and</p>
					<p>(iv) Class D shares of stock, thus converted upon transfer of class A, B, or C shares of stock to any person whatsoever in accordance with the following rules:</p>
					<p>- Class A shares of stock transferred by the National Government to any person shall become class D shares of stock, except for transfers to the Provinces, if previously authorized by law, in which case they shall not change their class.</p>
					<p>- Class B shares of stock transferred by the Provinces to any person other than a Province shall become class D shares of stock.</p>
					<p>- Class C shares of stock transferred to third parties outside the Shared Ownership Program shall become class D shares of stock.</p>
					<p>- Class D shares of stock shall not change their class by virtue of their paying in or acquisition by the National Government, the Provinces, or any other public legal entity or by the personnel participating in the Shared Ownership Program.</p>

					<p>(i) Authorize the merger with one or more companies;</p>

					<p>(ii) Approve the agreed or hostile takeover of the Corporation, through the acquisition of its shares by third parties, where such acquisition represents more than fifty percent (50 %) of the Corporation's capital stock;</p>

					<p>e) Capital Increases: The Corporation's capital may be increased by up to five times its original amount by resolution of the ordinary meeting of shareholders, in accordance with the provisions of section 188 of Law No.19550.

The ordinary meeting of shareholders shall establish the nature of the shares to be issued pursuant to the conditions set forth herein and may delegate to the Board of Directors the power to set the time of issuance and to establish all applicable payment terms and conditions. The ordinary meeting of shareholders shall be further empowered to perform such other delegation as may be authorized by law. Shares of preferred or common stock shall be issued by classes, preserving the existing proportion among the different share classes as of the date of issuance and without prejudice to any subsequent modification which may result from the exercise of preemptive and residual preemptive rights, as provided for in section 8 herein.</p>

					<p>Section 7 – Transfer of shares<br>
					a) Book-entry shares: Shares shall not be represented by certificates. They shall be held in book-entry form and shall be recorded in accounts kept under their holders' names in the Corporation, in commercial banks, investment banks or security clearing institutions, as authorized by the Board of Directors. Shares shall be indivisible and in the event of co-ownership, representation shall be unified when exercising rights or fulfilling obligations relating thereto.</p>

					<p>i) Construction and interpretation: For purposes of section 7, the term "indirectly" shall include the purchaser's parent companies, the companies controlled by the purchases or those that would end under the purchaser's control upon performance of a Takeover, a Takeover Bid, or a Related Transaction or upon execution of a Prior Agreement, granting, at the same time, control of the Corporation, of the companies under the joint control of the purchaser, and of other persons acting jointly with the purchaser.

This right shall be exercised in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Issuance, paying in, and payment conditions regarding class C shares of stock may be more beneficial for their purchasers than those applicable to the rest of the shares; provided further that, under no circumstances, shall such conditions be more onerous. Holders of preemptive rights -whatever the class of share- may assign such preemptive right to third parties, in which case the share entitling the holder to such preemptive right shall be or become a class D share of stock.</p>

					<p>b) Residual preemptive rights: residual preemptive rights shall be exercised within the period applicable to the exercise of preemptive rights and with respect to all classes of shares not initially paid in. For such purposes:</p>

					<p>(ii) Class B shares not paid in by the Provinces in exercise of their original preemptive rights, due to failure to exercise such right or to an assignment thereof, shall be allocated to the Provinces having paid in class B shares and willing to exercise their residual preemptive rights. The remaining shares shall be converted into class D shares and shall be offered to class D shareholders willing to exercise their residual preemptive rights with respect to non-paid in class B shares;</p>

					<p>(iii) Class C shares not paid in by those involved in the Shared Ownership Program in exercise of their original preemptive rights, due to failure to exercise such right or to an assignment thereof, shall be allocated to those participating in such program provided that they have paid in class C shares and stated their intention to exercise their residual preemptive rights. The remaining shares shall be converted into class D shares and shall be offered to shareholders of that class willing to exercise their residual preemptive rights with respect to non-paid in class C shares;</p>

					<p>(iv) Class D shares not paid in exercise of the preemptive rights attached to that class of shares shall be allocated to those who have paid in such class of shares and stated their intention to exercise their residual preemptive rights;</p>

					<p>(v) The remaining class D shares shall be allocated to shareholders of other classes willing to exercise their residual preemptive rights.</p>

					<p>c) Limits: all preemptive and residual preemptive rights referred to in the foregoing paragraphs shall exist only where required by applicable corporate laws or where necessary to comply with all applicable provisions of Laws No. 23696 and 24145.</p>
